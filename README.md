# 🎓 1000 Top Universities - University Ranking Analysis

Understanding Higher Education Performance with Data Visualization

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Higher education plays a crucial role in shaping the future by advancing knowledge, fostering innovation, and preparing skilled professionals. This project analyzes the **"Eighteen-Nineteen University Rankings Dataset"** to gain insights into global university rankings. The focus is on identifying patterns and factors that influence a university's position, such as educational quality, research output, faculty excellence, and alumni employment.

Through this project, we utilize data visualization techniques and statistical analysis to understand how top institutions achieve their global standing and how regional differences affect performance indicators.
